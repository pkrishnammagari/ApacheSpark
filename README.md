Mastering Apache Spark PDF

Generative AI gets all the glory. 
The data engine does all the work.
And for most teams, that engine is sputtering.
Slow feature engineering. Brittle pipelines. Models starved for high-quality data. Sound familiar? These aren't modeling problems; they're data engine problems.
Tired of seeing brilliant AI projects bottlenecked by their data infrastructure? Here is one solution.
